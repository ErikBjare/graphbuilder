graphbuilder
============

**Work in progress**

A simple way to build directed graphs, inspired by Blender.

## Intentions

Intended to be used for configuration and system overview in [Homebrain](https://github.com/Homebrain/Homebrain) and [ActivityWatch](https://github.com/ErikBjare/activitywatch) which are systems that are essentially configured by wiring agents together through something similar to a pubsub system.

Does not aim to be a complete solution, it aims to provide a common core for building graph-interfaces.

## Inspirations

 - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) nodes ([screenshot](https://mango.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/splashbot_nodes.png))
 - [Node-RED](https://github.com/node-red/node-red)
